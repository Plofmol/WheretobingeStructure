In our groupsproject we use set rules such as camel casing, same query's and same setup through layers.

## code Revieuws (GP)
In our groupsproject we also check on each other if the code works properly, the code is up to our rule stAndard and if it doesnt bring an unneccesarry security risk.

## automatic code scanning tool (IP)


# Learning Outcome 3: Agile Method
*You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method.*

Clarification:

**Agile** method: You are aware of most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. You are able to implement the process of your software project according to a chosen methodology.

## Scrum
what is scrum?

why scrum?

## Waterfall
what is waterfall?

why not waterfall?

## Kanban

# Learning Outcome 4: CI/CD
*You **design and implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.*

Clarification:

**Design and implement**: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

## Continuous Integration

## Continuous Deployment

# Learning Outcome 5: Cultural Differences and Ethics
*You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.*

Clarification:

**Recognize**:  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

**Take into account**: Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to work with other developers from different cultures; 
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

## Research paper

## group management
*You have studied a subset of the materials provided below.* (https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13025/pages/group-management-can-you-work-with-people-from-other-cultures?module_item_id=916360)
*You have applied the theory in a practical situation (preferably in your group but if this is not applicable then in your daily life).*

- Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life?

The common known work culture thing for Dutch people is the Dutch directness, not beating around the bush and getting straight to the point.
This can be too direct for people, altough other people prefer it this way. 

- What is your culture?

As I am half indonesian the main culture thing I was giving from my heritage is too be as welcoming as possible to every person no matter the gender, origin or anything. Everyone is welcome in our house no mather who you are. (if needed I can provide more context) 

- What did you  do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
For our group project we are working together with the OAMK group in Finland. Finnish people tend to be more shy and serious in the beginning, thats why in the beginning of our project I tried to step up as a mediator and set some rules in which everyone could be comfortable and provide the best version of themselves,
I also manage the communication channel which is our discord and act as the main person in between if we need anything. 

## software ethics

### Ethics in my application
*You have made an analysis of the ethical aspects of your application.*

Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 

The main ethical issue for my project is the handling of security as people can make accounts in which personal information is set. 

Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  

There should be no immediate ethical conflict by my software as there is no interaction between people.

Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts? 

*Irrelevant*

# Learning Outcome 6: Design (GP + IP) 
*You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**.*

## Research on basics (https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/12992/pages/ux-for-software-engineers-the-basics?module_item_id=911570)

## testing ux

- online test

- my own test (not sure if it's valid but it seemed fun)

When my frontend is done for the time being I want to test for the user experience and see if they have any comments / would like to change anything.
I want to test a few different groups of people and see how they react. I will test 2 people per group. the groups I want to test are: peer software students in IT, peer Students outside IT, digital illiterates. Below I will desribe per group on the results. I will have a format in which I will use on them all in this order:\

step 1: no information is given, look around.

step 2: Try to find your favorite film.

step 3: I give them a title and they should find on which streamingservice the film / series is available. 

step 4: Add your streamingservices and see if a title is on there. 

### UX Test

*Software peers*

- Wouter

- Ruben

- Mike

*Non-Software peers* 

- Amy

- Phong

*Digital illiterates (my parents)*

- Mom

- Dad





# Learning Outcome 7: Business processes
*You can explain **simple** business processes and **relate** them to the development of your software project.*

Clarification:

**Simple**: predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

**Relate**: understanding the relationships between the process and software.

## You have analyzed and modeled an existing business process from your project prior to the introduction of the software that you are creating. You model visualizes the process, including information aspects (data used/produced in the activities), and roles (who does which activity). 

## You have analyzed the process and drew conclusions on possible improvements in it (by means of introduction of your application)

## You have modeled the new process including data and role aspects in it and explained which activities are automated or supported by your application how this changes the work of the roles involved in the process

### general questions

- Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform? 
my software automatically checks in which country a movie or series is availlable on which information previously only was given through a random reddit post. 

- Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?

- Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence? 


- Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize the new process in a diagram? 

 
# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (IP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*


Clarification:

**Professional manner**: You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team. You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (GP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*

## Team Communication
**what we use:
We have an elaborate discord server in which we put everything we need in.
We have seperate textchannels for all documents, meetings, meetingreports, links, announcements, schedule and even a seperate channel per team.
We also have 4 voice channels divided in a general chat roon, 2 chat rooms, 1 per team and a meeting room.

## Communication with the Stakeholders
For communicating with out stakeholders we invite them through email to join a teams meeting for the sprint delivery.
Idividual questions online also go through teams.
If we need something else and they are at school we ask them directly.

## What are the others doing?

## Ask for feedback

## Technical Decisions
