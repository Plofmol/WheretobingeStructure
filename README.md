# Repository: WheretobingeStructure

## Description:
The WheretobingeStructure repository contains the code for a back-end project focused on learning how to build a web API application using Swagger. The project serves as a demonstration and educational resource for understanding the implementation and usage of Swagger within a web API application.

## How it Works:
The back-end code in this repository is designed to create a web API application that follows the OpenAPI specification, with Swagger being used as a tool to document, test, and interact with the API. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing API endpoints, making it easier to understand the available routes, input parameters, and response structures.

The code likely utilizes a web framework such as ASP.NET (for C#/.NET) to create the API endpoints and handle incoming requests. The Swagger integration allows for automatic generation of API documentation, including interactive documentation pages, sample requests, and response examples.

## Development Process:
The development process for this project would involve setting up the required development environment, choosing a suitable web framework, and integrating Swagger into the application. The developer would define the API endpoints, specify input and output models, and document them using Swagger annotations or configuration files.

## Conclusion:
The WheretobingeStructure repository showcases the implementation of a back-end project focusing on building a web API application using Swagger. It provides insights into how to create API endpoints, document them with Swagger, and leverage Swagger's capabilities for testing and documentation. This project serves as a valuable resource for learning and understanding the integration of Swagger within a web API application.
